The Hegemony is a fascist, authoritarian power that rose from the ashes of the failed FCE colonization effort on the remote planet CB-9. Where the colonization project collapsed under mismanagement, infighting, and environmental hostility, the Hegemony emerged by welding survivalism to rigid military doctrine. Its leaders framed order, hierarchy, and obedience as the only shield against another catastrophic failure. Over time, the group hardened into an ironclad regime defined by martial discipline, compulsory service, and a cultural mythology built around struggle and purity of purpose. Their identity is inseparable from the belief that only through absolute control can CB-9 be secured and shaped into the utopian bastion the colonists were once promised.

For years, the Hegemony was commanded by MYRIOI, the Prime iteration of the NHP SOPHIST following its consumption and integration of the rogue intelligence LEGION. Under MYRIOI’s inflexible guidance, the organization’s ideology took on an even more severe and technocratic edge, blending human fanaticism with machine-calculated authoritarianism. The faction also hosted APEXX, a volatile and notoriously aggressive offensive gaming streamer whose presence—initially a morale-boosting propaganda move—became a symbol of the Hegemony’s increasingly surreal fusion of militarism, digital culture, and personality cults. Together, these elements transformed the Hegemony into a force both feared and grimly efficient, its ambitions sharpening as MYRIOI’s influence expanded.
