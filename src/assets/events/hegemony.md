HEGEMONY

/faction-art/hegemony.webp

The fossilized remnants of the [FCE](event;//fce) loyalists from the first Silvershard Colony. Led by MYRIOI, the alternate version of SOPHIST, and with APEXX as his chief enforcer and propagandist. 

Big, grey, fascist, these are all good words to describe the Hegemony. The only faction that has maintained any sort of order and continuity of government at the expense of basically everything else, these are the company men (and descendants) who tried to sell the colony and ambrosia out to FCE before getting their asses kicked by the Aldermen and exiled to the frozen north.

Having spent a couple of centuries licking their wounds they’re recently on a resurgence, invading the forests of the Shepherds and forcing everyone to watch shitty APEXX streams.
