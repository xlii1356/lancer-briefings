Future Colonial Enterprises is fully owned subsidiary of the Smith-Shimano Corporation. Launching a new wave of colony ships to explore the far reaches of space, FCE lies on the cutting edge of space colonization. With our proprietary SOPHIST colony management software, we’ve managed to attract a wide range of colonists from scientists to movie stars. 

We provide everything a fledgling colony may need, from supplies and technology to boots-on-the-ground security forces. Our colonists can rest assured that our armed forces will always be ready to secure their safety and protect shareholder value. 

# FCE and Smith-Shimano Corporation have not been found guilty in any court of law for running any cloning program, flash or otherwise. All inquiries related to such matters should be addressed to legal@fce.omni
