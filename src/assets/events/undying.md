I believe they were a group from Cabochon, got hooked on Ambrosia and became ghoulified/undying, and eventually spread out east winding up in the Darkling pools and Dead City of Fontaine (and even further south through the Supplicant's Spine mountain range, where [PETARD](prime://status) was helping out their plan to darken the skies with a big fuck-off walking gun. I think it was called the Deepwell Throne? Eventually [HUBRIS](pilot://HUBRIS) started a ghoul rehab organization ("Orb NOW!"?)
