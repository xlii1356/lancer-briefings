After the attack from the east, we sent out a team of mech pilots to investigate the zone. Horrors awaited in the shadows of the forest. The footage sent back by REIKO *[link to folder with archived images and video]* depicted shadowy predator beasts, large flying birds of prey, and an enormous gnarled hand, almost like the woods itself was striking back against interlopers. Such is the place our assailants call their home. They call themselves the SHEPHERDS. Their enclave was invaded and seized by HEGEMONY and a small group of ousted leadership assaulted our base under the impression that the SILVERSHARD was an ally of their oppressors.

Our own pilot [GRAN GRAN](pilots://GRAN GRAN), as it turns out, was the original founder of the SHEPHERDS. Rather, an inexplicable past version of her established a home in the deep forest of eldritch horrors. She passed on in her sleep and was succeeded by her daughter, and then her daughter's daughter. Not much is known on who or how the elderly cat had children, but once the SHEPHERDS' current leader was rescued from a suicide mission in the Whitebrim mountains, the resemblance to GRAN's young self *[Attached image taken from background check dossier]* was uncanny. The return of their leader and their founder was enough of a flame to spark a full-blown rebellion. See combat report for further information.
