Once the terror of the Broadbend River and surrounding area, these pirates focused on destroying and salavaging whatever tech comes their way, using their enemies lost weapons and vehicles against them. Lead by Patrick Warren, alias DREDGE KING, they led frequent and devastating raids on Port Alder.

Through a concentrated strike on their stronghold, in conjunction with an all out [Aldermen](event://ALDERMEN)-lead assault, we were able to capture the DREDGE KING and without his leadership, the faction fractured into easily dispatched groups.
