Won the Smith Shimano Cup 3 years in a row and was recruited by the company and licensed to pilot a mech. Has never actually piloted a real frame. \n\nNikita “dodge_this” Sokolov, the former #2 (now #1) Mechromancer 4 player. In the 8 years Jaxxon has been asleep she’s won the SSCup 4 times, breaking his record (and winning her own pilot’s license)\n\nPicked up an 5 year ban from most gaming tournaments and streaming services for ironically posting pro-SECCOM propaganda. Figured he’d wait out the ban in cryostasis and give people time to forget about the incident and reinvent himself as an extreme combat streamer. ","history":"<p>Jaxxon grew up in “The Sink” a neighborhood in the slums of Giedi III, a coruscant-like city planet. People say there’s only 2 ways out of The Sink, pro-gaming or a body bag. Jaxxon managed to scrape together a rig and win a couple of online Candy Crush MCXIV tournaments, eventually securing sponsors, fame and fortune by the age of 16. He found his niche in the Mechromancer series of Frame Combat Sims winning the Smith Shimano Cup 3 times and getting winning a pilots license.  </p><p>Unfortunately with no adult supervision, no limits on his behavior and the unmatched arrogance at being the best at something, he quickly spiraled into edgelord behavior culminating in an incident where during a major tournament, he changed his spray to SECCOM DID NOTHING WRONG on a dare. </p><p>Picked up a universal 5 year ban from all streaming services and tournament, and was dropped by his sponsors. When SSC offered him a contract to head out to the frontier, he figured the 8 year cryosleep would let him ride out the ban and he leapt at the chance to pilot a real frame in real combat</p>","quirks":[],"current_hp":11,"background":"Celebrity","resistances":[],"mechs":[{"id":"6d9bf58d-fa3a-47b1-b9cb-dc604de6a98b","name":"It Was Better in Beta","notes":"","gm_note":"","frame":"mf_standard_pattern_i_everest","active":false,"current_structure":3,"current_move":5,"boost":0,"current_hp":25,"overshield":0,"current_stress":4,"current_heat":0,"current_repairs":7,"current_overcharge":1,"current_core_energy":1,"statuses":[],"conditions":[],"resistances":[],"reactions":[],"burn":0,"destroyed":false,"defeat":"","activations":1,"meltdown_imminent":false,"reactor_destroyed":false,"core_active":false,"cc_ver":"ERR","lastModified":"Mon May 12 2025 19:55:04 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)","isDeleted":false,"expireTime":"","deleteTime":"","portrait":"","cloud_portrait":"","loadouts":[{"id":"68a13633-c99c-45d4-94d1-b02b80659da2","name":"Primary","systems":[{"id":"ms_personalizations","uses":0,"destroyed":false,"cascading":false,"flavorName":"","flavorDescription":""},{"id":"ms_rapid_burst_jump_jet_system","uses":0,"destroyed":false,"cascading":false,"flavorName":"","flavorDescription":""},{"id":"ms_type_3_projected_shield","uses":0,"destroyed":true,"cascading":false,"flavorName":"","flavorDescription":"The GMS Type-3 Projected Shield traps and denies incoming projectiles by projecting an aggressive, superpositional anti-ballistic barrier."},{"id":"ms_pattern_a_smoke_charges","uses":3,"destroyed":false,"cascading":false,"flavorName":"","flavorDescription":""}],"integratedSystems":[],"mounts":[{"mount_type":"Main","lock":false,"slots":[{"size":"Main","weapon":{"id":"mw_shotgun","destroyed":false,"cascading":false,"loaded":true,"mod":null,"flavorName":"","flavorDescription":"Much like GMS mechs, GMS weapons are reliable galactic standards, made using interchangeable parts and built to withstand almost any conditions.
