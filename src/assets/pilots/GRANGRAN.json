She's thickened and hunched over from age. she smells like cats, mothballs, and faintly of soup. One bright green slitted eye is hidden under a droopy furry eyelid. the other is scarred over. Her cat face is white with the years, its snowy appearance spreading from the tip of her kitty nose up past her ears where it blends into a mottled mixture of grey and pink. She wears a cat eared knitted cap to keep the warmth in and a thick overcoat that's been patched over multiple times with mismatched fabric collected through the decades. An apron wrapped around her front is stained and threadbare with use. Her legs are wrapped in knitted leg warmers. </p>","notes":"Well, the soups and dumpling restaurant isn't doing so well anymore since Pan-Era moved into the neighborhood. and the youths passing through the waystation she set up shop in just don't appreciate good traditional food anymore. They're all chasing the next big trendy thing. Her grandson doesn't need her anymore either since he's become so independent. Things haven't been really going well after years of serving dumplings her community. With her kids and grandkid gone, she wants to fill the empty nest shaped hole in her heart. So she's closing up shop and moving, perhaps to start over in a new place.\nEunice used to be a pirate, then was coerced into doing under-the-table missions for the war effort or be executed. But nowadays it's all about the dumpling shop. Gran Gran probably knows quite a few regulars coming through her waystation who will miss her when she's gone. And she's fiercely protective. The old bag can be stubborn but will do anything for her family, even if its rash or unsavory. She cant see out of her left eye since that one encounter gone wrong.","history":"<p></p>","quirks":[],"current_hp":14,"background":"Smuggler","resistances":[],"mechs":[{"id":"fe6c2a1a-83b8-4269-84bb-942a6712ae3c","name":"Assisted Living","notes":"","gm_note":"","frame":"mf_standard_pattern_i_everest","active":false,"current_structure":4,"current_move":4,"boost":0,"current_hp":23,"overshield":0,"current_stress":4,"current_heat":0,"current_repairs":7,"current_overcharge":0,"current_core_energy":1,"statuses":[],"conditions":[],"resistances":[],"reactions":[],"burn":0,"destroyed":false,"defeat":"","activations":1,"meltdown_imminent":false,"reactor_destroyed":false,"core_active":false,"cc_ver":"ERR","lastModified":"Thu Nov 07 2024 11:24:03 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)","isDeleted":false,"expireTime":"","deleteTime":"","portrait":"","cloud_portrait":"https://d2c79xe1p61csc.cloudfront.net/frames/mf_genghis.png","loadouts":[{"id":"8ae21f57-d05e-4fac-9648-4c605cc3ea6b","name":"Primary","systems":[{"id":"ms_turret_drones","uses":4,"destroyed":false,"cascading":false,"flavorName":"","flavorDescription":"The use of turret drones is a rather traditional form of force multiplication – one that has remained the backbone of defense in many theaters."},{"id":"ms_pattern_a_smoke_charges","uses":4,"destroyed":false,"cascading":false,"flavorName":"","flavorDescription":""},{"id":"ms_explosive_vents","uses":0,"destroyed":false,"cascading":false,"flavorName":"","flavorDescription":"With the right tweaks, it becomes possible to dump excess heat into the area directly surrounding a chassis.
