The sudden exposure essentially removes the mech and its pilot from realtime. The user experiences around 10 seconds of subjective time – a brief window, in which they can act independently of local realtime.<br>SSC recommends against abuse of this system, as the effects of long-term exposure to local sidereal time are still unknown."
