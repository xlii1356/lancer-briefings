Cultists from "Holy" Mount Anzonel. First encountered at the Shrine of the Golden Fields, where they betrayed the Lancers after showing some fake hospitality. The cultists hated ghouls and any sort of human augmentations or imperfections. They viewed [MERLIN](pilot://MERLIN) as a false prophet, and spent a lot of time carving about it. We later learned from a rescued captive named Qwen that the cultists (led by MINISTER)  were trying to sacrifice "imperfect" people to the dormant volcano Anzonel to try to re-activate it and obliterate the continent.
The Lancers learned that the "holy" light that empowered the cultists was actually a form of nanite, created by a huge machine in the caldera of Anzonel.
