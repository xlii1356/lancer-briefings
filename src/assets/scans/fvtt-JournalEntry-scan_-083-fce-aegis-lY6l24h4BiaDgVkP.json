While active, the Aegis is Immobilized, but all ranged, melee, and tech attacks against characters or objects within the affected area that originate outside the area receive +2 Difficulty and cannot result in critical hits. Characters within the affected area may attack characters within and outside of the area normally.<br />Allied characters within the affected area also gain Immunity to Impaired and Slowed, and remove these conditions when they enter the area if they already have them.<br />This effect lasts until the Aegis ends it as a protocol, or until the Aegis is Stunned, Jammed, or destroyed. Involuntary movement causes the shield to move with the Aegis.</p></details><details><summary>REGENERATIVE SHIELDING</summary><p>The Aegis has Immunity to Impaired and Slowed and can’t be critically hit.</p></details><details><summary>RING OF FIRE</summary><p>Any hostile characters that start their turn inside the area affected by the Defense Net or that enter it for the first time in a round take 2 heat and become Shredded until they leave the area.</p></details><details><summary>HARDLIGHT COVER SYSTEM</summary><p>As a quick action, deploy a line3 hardlight wall. The wall is immune to damage and effects and grants hard cover. Characters that receive this cover gain Resistance to damage from Line, Blast, Burst, and Cone attacks.</p></details><details><summary>GUARDIAN</summary><p>Allied characters can use the Aegis for hard cover.</p></details><p>SPACER</p><details><summary>MANEUVERABLE</summary><p>The Spacer moves normally in zero-g environments.</p></details><details><summary>THUMPER GRENADES</summary><p>The Spacer expends a charge for the following effect:<br />Thumper grenade (Grenade, range 5, Blast 1): Characters in the affected area must pass an Agility check or be knocked 3 spaces back, directly away from the center of the explosion. If this causes them to collide with an obstruction, they are also knocked Prone.</p></details></div>"
