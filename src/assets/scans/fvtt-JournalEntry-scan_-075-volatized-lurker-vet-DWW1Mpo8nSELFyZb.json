Additionally, while inside a SHROUD ZONE:</p><ul><li>Lurkers (including this one) become INVISIBLE and gain RESISTANCE to all damage and heat.</li><li>Hostile characters are SHREDDED and IMPAIRED.</li></ul><br />Shroud Zones can only be targeted by tech attacks and weapons that target E-DEFENSE (e.g., smart weapons). They have E-DEFENSE {10/13/16} and disperse upon any successful attack.<br />The Lurker can have no more than three SHROUD ZONES active at the same time. SHROUD ZONES can overlap each other, but their effects do not stack.<p></p></details><details><summary>SCOURING WHIP FOR THE UNWORTHY</summary><p>This weapon gains Threat 3 and +1 Accuracy when used within a SHROUD ZONE.</p><ul><li>On hit: The target is pulled adjacent to the Lurker, or as close as possible.</li><li>On critical hit: As above, and the target is immediately GRAPPLED.</li></ul><p></p></details><details><summary>UMBRAL SHIFT</summary><p>The Lurker teleports to a SHROUD ZONE within line of sight.</p></details><details><summary>FLAMING MAUL OF RIGHTEOUS FURY</summary><p>This weapon deals double damage when used within a SHROUD ZONE</p></details><details><summary>EMPOWER SHROUD</summary><p>The Lurker expands a SHROUD ZONE they currently occupy to Blast 2.
