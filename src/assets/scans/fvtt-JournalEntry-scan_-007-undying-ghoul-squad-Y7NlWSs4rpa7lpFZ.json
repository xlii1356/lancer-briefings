When the Squad takes a certain amount of damage, it results in the narrative death of one or more of those soldiers. Eventually, this reduces the number of attacks the Squad can make each turn, as listed in the relevant weapon profiles. By default, the Squad is made up of 10 members, each with 1 HP.</p></details><details><summary>RANK AND FILE</summary><p>The Squad can’t take the Grunt, Veteran, or Ultra templates, and can never gain Structure.</p></details><details><summary>STRENGTH IN NUMBERS</summary><p>The Squad has Resistance to all damage from attacks that aren’t line, Cone, Burst or Blast , and is Immune to Grapple, Ram, Knockback, and Stunned.</p></details><details><summary>SPREAD OUT</summary><p>Instead of tracking the position of individual soldiers, the Squad’s members are assumed to move freely within the space it occupies. Other characters can freely move through and end their turn in spaces occupied by the Squad, and as long as the Squad occupies at least 2 free spaces it can end its turn overlapping obstructions, cover, or other characters. As its size doesn’t reflect its mass, the Squad cannot Grapple or Ram.</p></details><details><summary>UNDERSIZE</summary><p>Individual soldiers can easily duck behind cover, but the sheer force of mech-scale weapons limits how effectively they can be shielded. The squad always has soft cover, even in the open, but can’t benefit from hard cover.</p></details><details><summary>THICC</summary><p>The Squad gains +1 Armor.</p></details><p>PIRATE</p><details><summary>PRYING CLAWS</summary><p>The Pirate attempts to pry open the cockpit of a character adjacent to them. The target must succeed on a Hull save or the pilot is forced to immediately exit their mech as though Dismounting.</p></details></div>"
