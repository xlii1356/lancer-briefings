In 1d3+2 rounds, if any coreworms are still attached, they reach the cockpit and savage the pilot, reducing them to 0 HP. The target knows how many rounds it will take for the drones to bore though, and how many are attached.<br />The target and allied characters adjacent to them can remove one drone at a time with a successful Systems or Engineering check as a quick action. Additionally, if the target is Shut Down, the coreworms are confused and their timer pauses.</p></details></div>"
