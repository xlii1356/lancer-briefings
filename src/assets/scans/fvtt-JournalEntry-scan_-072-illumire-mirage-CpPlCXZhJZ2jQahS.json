On a success, they take {2/3/4} Heat and all attacks they make until the end of their next turn treat their targets as having soft cover.</p></details><details><summary>GLITCH SCANNERS</summary><p>The Mirage’s advanced electronic countermeasures play havoc with enemy systems, causing them to register false positives on the battlefield. They may teleport up to two allied characters within Sensors, moving them 5 spaces in any direction – revealing their “true” locations. This movement ignores engagement and doesn’t provoke reactions.<br />The Mirage also gains the Blip reaction.</p></details><details><summary>BLIP</summary><p>Trigger:A hostile character takes action in line of sight.<br />The Mirage may teleport one allied character within Sensors 5 spaces in any direction.</p></details><details><summary>DATAVEIL</summary><p>By default, the Mirage is Invisible and can transfer this status to another character within line of sight as a quick action. When they do so, the Mirage ceases to be Invisible, and only regains the status when they transfer it back as a quick action or transfer it to another character; otherwise, this effect lasts until the Mirage is destroyed.</p></details><details><summary>REALITY FLICKER</summary><p>The Mirage teleports when they make a standard move.</p></details><details><summary>MULTIPLICITY</summary><p>Trigger:A allied character in line of sight is hit.<br />The attacker must make a Systems save. On a failure, the Mirage’s ally gains Immunity to the attack’s damage and effects and may teleport up to 5 spaces in the direction of their choice.</p></details><p>PIRATE</p><details><summary>PIRATE SYSTEMS AND TRAITS</summary><p>When choosing optional systems, the Pirate can also choose from the Pirate Systems and Traits list.</p></details><details><summary>DEADLY</summary><p>The Pirate deals +1d6 bonus damage on critical hits.</p></details><details><summary>SLAVER SIGNAL</summary><p>A piloted mech or vehicle within Range 10 must make a Systems save. On a failure, all pilots and other Biological characters inside the target are overcome by the signal, becoming Stunned. Unless their mech or vehicle has an AI, it also becomes Stunned. If any affected characters (or their mech or vehicle) take damage, they are jolted awake – ending the effect. Characters adjacent to the target can also end the effect by blotting out the signal with a successful Systems check as a full action. Otherwise, the effect lasts until the Pirate is destroyed.</p></details></div>"
