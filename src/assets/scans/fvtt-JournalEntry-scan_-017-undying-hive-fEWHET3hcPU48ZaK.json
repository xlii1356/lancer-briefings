At T3, it can make three attacks at a time.</p></details><details><summary>DRONE BARRAGE</summary><p>The Hive makes a tech attack against a character within Sensors. On a success, the target chooses one: they become Immobilized and Impaired until the end of their next turn, or they immediately move up to 5 spaces in a direction chosen by the Hive. This movement ignores engagement and does not provoke reactions.</p></details><details><summary>RAZOR SWARMS</summary><p>The Hive deploys a Blast 1 razor swarm in a free area within Sensors. Allied characters gain soft cover as long as they are at least partially within the affected area. Hostile characters start their turn at least partially within the area or move into it for the first time in a round take {2/4/6} Burn. The Hive can deploy any number of razor swarms, each of which persists for the rest of the scene or until the Hive is destroyed.</p></details><details><summary>GRIND MANIPLE</summary><p>The Hive releases a swarm of tiny, hard to hit drones that make a tech attack against a hostile character within Sensors and line of sight. On hit, the drones clamp on, causing them to take 2 Burn each time they take any action or reaction until the end of their next turn.</p></details><p>VETERAN</p><details><summary>UNDYING</summary><p></p><p>The first time that this undying is destroyed each combat, they are actually reanimating – they appear to be destroyed, but have 1 HP. Characters adjacent to the undying can reveal this with a successful Systems check or pilot skill check; otherwise, the Veteran remains unnoticed until they move or take an action.</p><p></p></details></div>"
