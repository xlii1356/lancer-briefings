Pick a character that the Cataphract passed through or ended adjacent to; they make a Hull save at +1 Difficulty. On a failure, they are grappled by the Cataphract and pulled with the Cataphract to the end of their movement.</p></details><details><summary>POINT-DEFENSE SHIELD</summary><p>The Cataphract has Resistance to all damage from the closest hostile character. If multiple characters are equally close, this effect does not apply.</p></details><details><summary>ELECTRIFIED LASSO</summary><p>A character in line of sight and range 5 must make a Hull save. On a failure, they are pulled as close as possible to the Cataphract; if they become adjacent, the Cataphract automatically grapples them.</p></details><details><summary>CAPACITOR DISCHARGE</summary><p>As long as the Cataphract isn’t Slowed or Immobilized, they gain Resistance to Energy damage and heat. At the end of the Cataphract’s turn, all characters adjacent to them take {2/3/4} Heat.</p></details></div>"
