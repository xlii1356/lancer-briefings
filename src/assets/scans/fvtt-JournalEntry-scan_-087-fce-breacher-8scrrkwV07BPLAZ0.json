Obstructions and objects in the Breacher’s path take {10/20/30} AP kinetic damage. The Breacher passes through any obstructions destroyed this way and continues moving until they have moved 6 spaces or fail to destroy an obstruction. Any characters in the Breacher’s path must succeed on an Agility save or be pushed out of the way as directly as possible and knocked Prone.</p></details><details><summary>BREAK ARMOR</summary><p>Characters that are successfully attacked more than once in a turn by the Breacher’s Dual Shotguns become Shredded for the rest of the scene.</p></details><details><summary>SUPERIOR RAM</summary><p>When using Breach Ram the Breacher moves 4 more spaces, and targets have +1 Difficulty on the Agility save.</p></details><details><summary>FOLLOWER COUNT</summary><p>The Breacher makes a tech attack against a character within Sensors. On a success, the Breacher gains +{1/2/3} Accuracy on all attacks against their target, and may Boost once per turn as a free action so long as it moves them directly towards their target. This lasts until either character is destroyed and cannot be changed to a new target.</p></details><details><summary>THERMAL CHARGE</summary><p>The Breacher may expend a charge to throw a grenade to a space within range 5. Characters in the ensuing Blast 2 explosion take {2/4/6} Burn if they fail an Agility save, half on a success. Objects, terrain, and Deployables take {10/20/30} AP kinetic damage.</p></details><p>SPACER</p><details><summary>MANEUVERABLE</summary><p>The Spacer moves normally in zero-g environments.</p></details><details><summary>SEALANT TRAP</summary><p>When a hostile character moves adjacent to the mine, characters within a Burst 1 area are covered with a spray of thick, fast-drying sealant and become Immobilized. They remain stuck until the sealant takes sufficient damage to break; it counts as having {5/10/15} HP and Evasion 5.</p></details></div>"
