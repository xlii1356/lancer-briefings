Additionally, while inside a SHROUD ZONE:</p><ul><li>Lurkers (including this one) become INVISIBLE and gain RESISTANCE to all damage and heat.</li><li>Hostile characters are SHREDDED and IMPAIRED.</li></ul><br />Shroud Zones can only be targeted by tech attacks and weapons that target E-DEFENSE (e.g., smart weapons). They have E-DEFENSE {10/13/16} and disperse upon any successful attack.<br />The Lurker can have no more than three SHROUD ZONES active at the same time. SHROUD ZONES can overlap each other, but their effects do not stack.<p></p></details><details><summary>UMBRAL SHIFT</summary><p>The Lurker teleports to a SHROUD ZONE within line of sight.</p></details><details><summary>EMPOWER SHROUD</summary><p>The Lurker expands a SHROUD ZONE they currently occupy to Blast 2. This can cause it to envelop other characters. In addition, it now takes two successful attacks to disperse the effect.</p></details><details><summary>DEVOURING SHARD</summary><p>While inside a SHROUD ZONE, the Lurker can also spew out a Cone 3 torrent of razor sharp nanites as a quick action. Characters within the affected area must pass an ENGINEERING save or take {4/5/6} Energy AP. On a success, they take half damage.</p></details><p>VETERAN</p><details><summary>VETERANCY</summary><p>The Veteran gains +1 Accuracy on all checks and saves for one mech skill (chosen at creation): Hull, Agility, Systems, or Engineering.</p></details><details><summary>VETERAN TRAITS</summary><p>The Veteran gains one Veteran Trait per tier.</p></details><details><summary>REINFORCED</summary><p>The Veteran gains +1 Structure and +1 Stress.</p></details><details><summary>LIGHTNING REFLEXES</summary><p>Whenever the Veteran is attacked using any Heavy or Superheavy weapon, first roll 1d6.
