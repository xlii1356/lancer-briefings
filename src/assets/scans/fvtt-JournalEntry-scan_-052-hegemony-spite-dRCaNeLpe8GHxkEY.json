While affected by this virus they cannot clear any heat by any means (except for overheating). This effect lasts for the rest of the scene, until the Spite is destroyed, or until the affected character moves adjacent to the Spite. While at least one character is affected by the virus, the Spite is IMMOBILIZED. <br />Targets that already suffer from the virus take double damage if imprisoned again.</p></details><details><summary>ENTHRONE</summary><p>The Spite becomes IMMOBILIZED and activates a crackling defensive shield. While this shield is active, any characters that make ranged or melee attacks against the Spite or its adjacent allies take {3/4/5} Energy AP before the attack roll is made. This effect lasts until the end of the Spite’s next turn, or if it ends this effect as a quick action.</p></details><details><summary>GUARDIAN</summary><p>Adjacent allied characters can use the Spite for hard cover.</p></details><details><summary>SEIZE</summary><p>A hostile character within SENSORS and line of sight must pass a SYSTEMS save or take 2/3/4 Heat and become IMMOBILIZED until the end of their next turn. On a success, they take no heat and are instead SLOWED until the end of their next turn.</p></details><details><summary>INSIDIOUS PRISON</summary><p>Characters affected by IMPRISON take {5/7/9} Energy AP immediately after they OVERCHARGE . They are aware of this effect, and this damage cannot be prevented or reduced in any way.</p></details><details><summary>CARCERI</summary><p>The Spite uses IMPRISON on all characters of its choice within line of sight and SENSORS.</p></details><details><summary>ENTRENCHED</summary><p>The Spite has IMMUNITY to involuntary movement forced by hostile characters.</p></details></div>"
