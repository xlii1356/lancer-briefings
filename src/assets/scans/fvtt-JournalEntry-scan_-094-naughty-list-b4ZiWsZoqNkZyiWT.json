All characters know which spaces have been chosen. The Rainmaker fires a volley of auto-targeting rockets into the air: the next time a hostile character moves through, starts their turn in, or passes above one of the chosen spaces – no more than 10 spaces up – they are hit by a rocket, taking {5/6/7} kinetic damage. Each space can only be triggered once.<br />This effect lasts until the start of the Rainmaker’s next turn.</p><p></p></details><details><summary>HUNTSMAN</summary><p>Against characters with Lock On, the Rainmaker’s weapons gain Smart, Seeking, and AP.</p></details><details><summary>ATLAS MISSILES</summary><p>The Rainmaker chooses a space of ground in line of sight and Range 30, obvious to all characters with line of sight to the space. The Rainmaker launches a missile that lands at the end of the next round making a Blast 2 explosion; affected characters take {16/20/24} Explosive damage, half if they pass an Agility save.</p></details><details><summary>HADES MISSILES</summary><p>All characters in a Cone 3 area starting within range 20 of the Rainmaker take {4/6/8} Energy damage and 2 heat, half if they pass an Agility save.

This movement ignores engagement and does not provoke reactions.</p></details><details><summary>MISSILE SWARM</summary><p>This weapon deals double damage to characters with Lock On and doesn’t affect allied characters.</p></details><details><summary>CHAFF LAUNCHERS</summary><p>After using Barrel Roll, the Ace counts as being in soft cover until the end of their next turn; additionally, Barrel Roll can be used against tech attacks.</p></details></div>"
