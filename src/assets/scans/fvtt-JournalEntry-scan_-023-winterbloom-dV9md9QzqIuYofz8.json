Characters can disarm them by succeeding on a Systems check as a quick action while in the same space; however, on a failure, the mine detonates.<p></p></details><details><summary>SPEED DEPLOYER</summary><p>Lay Mines deploys two mines at a time, not one.</p></details><details><summary>GRAV SPIKE</summary><p>A character within line of sight and range 5 must succeed on a Systems save, or a grav spike attaches itself to them. The Seeder can detonate all grav spikes as a protocol, causing targets to automatically take {4/6/8} AP Explosive damage and be pulled 3 spaces in a direction chosen by the Seeder. A quick action and passed Systems save removes a grav spike.</p></details><p>VETERAN</p><details><summary>REINFORCED</summary><p>The Veteran gains +1 Structure and +1 Stress.</p></details><details><summary>VETERANCY</summary><p>The Veteran gains +1 Accuracy on all checks and saves for one mech skill (chosen at creation): Hull, Agility, Systems, or Engineering.</p></details><details><summary>VETERAN TRAITS</summary><p>The Veteran gains one Veteran Trait per tier.</p></details><details><summary>VIPER’S SPEED</summary><p>The Veteran always takes the first turn, even acting before PCs. Whenever there is a question about who acts first – in both narrative play and mech combat – it is always the Veteran.
