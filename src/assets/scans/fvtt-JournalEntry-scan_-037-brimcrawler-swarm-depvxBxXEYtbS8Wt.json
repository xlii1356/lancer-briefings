When the Squad takes a certain amount of damage, it results in the narrative death of one or more of those soldiers. Eventually, this reduces the number of attacks the Squad can make each turn, as listed in the relevant weapon profiles. By default, the Squad is made up of 10 members, each with 1 HP.</p></details><details><summary>SPREAD OUT</summary><p>Instead of tracking the position of individual soldiers, the Squad’s members are assumed to move freely within the space it occupies. Other characters can freely move through and end their turn in spaces occupied by the Squad, and as long as the Squad occupies at least 2 free spaces it can end its turn overlapping obstructions, cover, or other characters. As its size doesn’t reflect its mass, the Squad cannot Grapple or Ram.</p></details><details><summary>RANK AND FILE</summary><p>The Squad can’t take the Grunt, Veteran, or Ultra templates, and can never gain Structure.</p></details></div>"
