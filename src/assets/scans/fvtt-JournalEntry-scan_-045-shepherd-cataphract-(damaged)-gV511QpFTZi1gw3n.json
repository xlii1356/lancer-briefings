If multiple characters are equally close, this effect does not apply.</p></details><details><summary>ELECTRIFIED BOLA</summary><p>A flying character in Range 10 must make an Agility save. On a failure, they land immediately and become Immobilized until the end of their next turn. This counts as falling but without damage.</p></details></div>"
