Hey Team, Diamond here  

I failed to report it last mission, but AEGLE lost her life in the line of duty. She was helping us unlock the enemy base on the glaciar with her bioreadings, and got caught in blanket fire from an enemy mech.  

I can't say I knew her too well, but she gave it her all on this mission to help us save the world from annihilation. I'll ask for a full service memorial once this is all squared away.  

Thanks to her help we were able to get into the manufacting center inside the glacier, where multiple weapons were being massed produced. There were plenty of targets to pick from, and we knew we were under a time crunch so we worked fast. Jaxxon did his usual movement shenanigans, Trigger got into an old fashioned saloon duel (from what I heard, it was hard to see haha) and Merlin...took a while to get going but you know him, once that scythe is swinging enemies drop. I plugged away at various opponents and infrastructure with my missiles.  
Right at the last minute, we were able to complete all of our objectives. And now it sounds like we've got to deal with a massive missile strike...normally I like those but I'm supposed to be the one doing them!  

Well, I'll see you guys later if we succeed, and I'll see y'all in the afterlife if we don't. Diamond out!
