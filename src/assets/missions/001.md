## **He Sees You When You’re Sleeping**

**A TEAM**

### Mission Briefing 
Respond to BULWARK’s distress call, and aid the Aldermen in defense of their home. Orbital strikes have already damaged much of the city, but it seems that their main target was a position near the center of the city - something BULWARK accidentally revealed to be the “Medusa-2.” Repel these enemies and then investigate this mysterious entity - it’s currently unclear who we can trust, so tread carefully.

### Required 
N/A
