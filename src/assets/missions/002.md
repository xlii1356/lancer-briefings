### Mission Briefing 
An orbital satellite has been launched from a region near the planet’s north pole, an area known as the Coldstar Glacier. It’s already proven to be a threat, both scanning the population and launching strikes against the Aldermen. A Team will travel via the retrofitted Winter Rose and investigate the launch site, which used to be an old prewar research outpost. Find a way to neutralize the threat at its source, or otherwise disable the satellite remotely.
